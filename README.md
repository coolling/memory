## 游戏规则
该游戏在普通的翻牌记忆游戏做了一些变化<br/>
游戏分为闯关模式和娱乐模式<br/>
### `闯关模式`
闯关模式一共有十五关,前五关每前进一关，倒计时减少5秒；进入第六关后，牌数增加，时间重新变为60时，每前进一关，倒计时减少3秒，同时增加炸弹牌和加时牌，若翻到炸弹牌，如在25秒内无法过关，游戏失败，若翻到加时牌，则倒计时增加10秒（若之前翻过炸弹牌，则时间加在爆炸倒计时上）；进入第十一关，牌数增加，在之前的基础上再增加新规则：每十秒，会弹出一到简单的计算题，回答正确才能继续（在此期间，倒计时暂停）

### `娱乐模式`

娱乐模式分为三个难度档次，不进行倒计时，无功能牌，无算术打扰，属于老年养生模式，倒计时改为从0开始记时。

娱乐模式与闯关模式的记录排行可以从主页点击排行牌图标查看<br/>
并且通过排行榜点击闯关的记录，可从所点击的关卡下一关继续闯关，相当于一种读档的模式吧<br/>
同时该游戏还增加了背景音乐

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
